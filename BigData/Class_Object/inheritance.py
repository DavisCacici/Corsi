"""
Inheritance allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods 
and properties from another class.

Parent class is the class being inherited from, also called base class.

Child class is the class that inherits from another class, also called derived class.

class Person:
  def __init__(self, fname, lname):
    self.firstname = fname
    self.lastname = lname

  def printname(self):
    print(self.firstname, self.lastname)

x = Person("John", "Doe")
# x.printname()

# To create a class that inherits the functionality from another class, 
# send the parent class as a parameter when creating the child class

class Student(Person):
  pass

s = Student("Mike", "Olsen")
# print(s)
# s.printname()
